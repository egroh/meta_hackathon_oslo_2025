      "The documents discuss the political process of renegotiation of the United Kingdom's (UK) demands on matters of sovereignty since its launch by David Cameron in January 2013. The demands include \"an even closer union,\" subsidiarity, the role of national parliaments, the British exception with regard to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) and the issue of national security. The documents analyze the Prime Minister's explicit request, the position of the main Member States, the negotiation and its outcome, and the reasons for the demand from the British viewpoint. The documents also discuss the impact that the result may have both on the current model of the EU constitutionalized in the Treaties and on the integration project, that is, the chances of its future development. The documents also discuss the European Council agreement of February 2016, in both its political and legal aspects. The study of the legal nature of the Decision by the Heads of State or Government is particularly important, in that it will allow us to anticipate its institutional consequences. The documents also discuss the European Commission's political programme, which aims to improve the regulation of the EU, and the Commission\n"
