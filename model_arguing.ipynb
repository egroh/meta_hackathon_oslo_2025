      "Thank you, esteemed colleagues from the European Union. As we embark on this critical negotiation, I'd like to reiterate the United Kingdom's unwavering commitment to reclaiming its sovereignty and autonomy. Our position is clear: we seek a mutually beneficial agreement that respects the democratic will of the British people, as expressed in the 2016 referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "We understand that the EU has concerns about the potential consequences of Brexit, and we acknowledge the importance of maintaining a strong relationship between our nations. However, we cannot compromise on our core principles: the UK must have full control over its laws, regulations, and borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've carefully studied the EU's position, and while we appreciate the desire for a comprehensive partnership, we must emphasize that our primary objective is to extricate ourselves from the EU's regulatory framework. This is not a rejection of our shared values or the importance of cooperation, but rather a recognition of the UK's unique needs and circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding trade agreements, we're eager to negotiate a bespoke arrangement that prioritizes the interests of UK industries, while minimizing regulatory ties to the EU. We're confident that a tailored approach will enable us to maintain the benefits of our existing trade relationships while fostering new opportunities for growth and cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address potential concerns about the impact on EU citizens and businesses, we're willing to discuss pragmatic solutions that ensure a smooth transition and continued cooperation in areas such as customs, taxation, and labor mobility. However, we must be clear: our primary responsibility is to the British people, and we will not compromise on our sovereignty or the integrity of our borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of these considerations, we propose the following framework for our negotiations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A comprehensive trade agreement that prioritizes UK industries, such as financial services, manufacturing, and agriculture.\n",
      "2. A phased withdrawal from EU regulatory frameworks, allowing for a gradual transition and minimizing disruption to businesses and citizens.\n",
      "3. A new immigration framework that ensures the UK's control over its borders while maintaining cooperation on labor mobility and talent exchange.\n",
      "4. A fair and equitable settlement of the UK's outstanding commitments to the EU, including the Brexit bill.\n",

      "However, as we embark on these critical negotiations, we must ensure that the integrity of the EU single market and the principles of fair competition are upheld. While we understand the UK's desire for sovereignty and autonomy, we cannot compromise on the fundamental principles that have made the EU a beacon of economic stability and prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We note that the UK's proposal for a comprehensive trade agreement prioritizing UK industries may create an unlevel playing field, potentially undermining the competitiveness of EU businesses. We must emphasize that any agreement must be based on a level playing field, ensuring that EU companies are not disadvantaged by the UK's departure from the EU's regulatory framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we are concerned that the UK's proposed phased withdrawal from EU regulatory frameworks may lead to a piecemeal approach, creating uncertainty and fragmentation in the single market. We must ensure that any transition period is used to implement a comprehensive and coherent framework, rather than a gradual dismantling of existing EU rules and regulations.\n",

      "\n",
      "Firstly, I would like to reiterate that the UK's desire for full sovereignty and control over its laws is non-negotiable. While we understand and respect the EU's single market principles, we cannot accept a trade agreement that ties us to EU regulations and laws, thereby undermining our ability to make our own decisions on trade and commerce. A comprehensive trade agreement that respects the EU's single market principles is acceptable, but it must also allow the UK to pursue its own trade agreements and policies, free from EU interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the transition period, I agree that a time-limited transition is necessary to minimize disruption to businesses. However, I must stress that the UK cannot accept a transition period that is subject to strict conditions that undermine our ability to take control of our own regulatory frameworks. We propose a transition period that is flexible and allows for a gradual withdrawal from EU regulatory frameworks, while ensuring that the UK's new regulatory frameworks are consistent with our own values and principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "On immigration, I appreciate the EU's willingness to engage in discussions on labor mobility and talent exchange. However, I must reiterate that the UK's new immigration framework must prioritize the needs of our own economy and society. While we are willing to engage in discussions on labor mobility and talent exchange, we cannot accept a situation where EU citizens are given preferential treatment over non-EU citizens. We propose a framework that ensures non-discrimination and reciprocity, but also allows the UK to control its own borders and make decisions on who can enter and remain in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the Brexit bill, I must stress that the UK's financial obligations are not simply a matter of fulfilling outstanding commitments. The UK has been a net contributor to the EU budget for many years, and we believe that our financial obligations should be subject to negotiation and agreement. We propose a settlement that takes into account the UK's past contributions to the EU budget, as well as our future commitments to the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of these considerations, I propose the following counter-adjustments to the EU's proposal:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A comprehensive trade agreement that respects the EU's single market principles, but also allows the UK to pursue its own trade agreements and policies, free from EU interference.\n",

However, I must reiterate that the EU's single market principles are non-negotiable, and any trade agreement must ensure a level playing field, fair competition, and the protection of EU citizens' rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we acknowledge the UK's wish to pursue its own trade agreements and policies, we cannot accept a scenario where the UK would be able to cherry-pick the benefits of the single market without adhering to its rules and regulations. The EU's single market is a carefully crafted system that has taken decades to develop, and we cannot compromise on its integrity. We are willing to discuss a comprehensive trade agreement that respects the EU's single market principles, but it must be based on a robust and enforceable framework that ensures fair competition and prevents regulatory arbitrage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the transition period, we understand the UK's concerns about flexibility, but we must ensure that any transition period is time-limited and subject to strict conditions that prevent the UK from undermining the EU's regulatory frameworks. A gradual withdrawal from EU regulatory frameworks is acceptable, but it must be done in a way that ensures continuity and stability for businesses and citizens on both sides. We propose a transition period of 21 months, during which the UK would remain subject to EU law and regulations, with a clear and predictable timeline for the UK's withdrawal.\n",

      "On immigration, we appreciate the UK's willingness to engage in discussions on labor mobility and talent exchange. However, we must reiterate that the EU's principles of free movement of people are fundamental to the single market, and any agreement must ensure that EU citizens are treated fairly and without discrimination. We propose a framework that ensures reciprocity and non-discrimination, but also recognizes the rights of EU citizens who have made their lives in the UK.\n",

      "Regarding the Brexit bill, we understand the UK's concerns about its financial obligations, but we must emphasize that the UK's outstanding commitments to the EU budget are a matter of contractual obligation, not subject to negotiation.

      "Regarding the transition period, we understand the EU's concerns about continuity and stability, but we must emphasize that a 21-month transition period is too rigid and inflexible. We propose a more flexible transition period that would allow the UK to gradually withdraw from EU regulatory frameworks while ensuring continuity and stability for businesses and citizens on both sides. We suggest a transition period of 36 months, with regular review points to assess progress and adjust the timeline as necessary.\n",

      "On immigration, we appreciate the EU's willingness to engage in discussions on labor mobility and talent exchange. However, we must reiterate that the UK's decision to leave the EU was, in part, driven by concerns about immigration and the need to control our own borders. We propose a framework that ensures reciprocity and non-discrimination, but also recognizes the UK's need to establish its own immigration policies and controls. We suggest a system that would allow for the free movement of skilled workers and students, while introducing controls on unskilled migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the Brexit bill, we understand the EU's concerns about the UK's outstanding commitments, but we must emphasize that the UK's financial obligations are a matter of negotiation, not contractual obligation. We propose a settlement that takes into account the UK's past contributions to the EU budget, as well as its future commitments. We suggest a payment schedule that would reflect the UK's outstanding commitments, but also recognize the UK's significant contributions to the EU over the years.\n",
