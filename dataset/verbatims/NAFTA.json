        "speech": "Good evening, distinguished colleagues and partners. Today marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discussions about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. For years, this agreement has shaped the trade relations between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. However, as we continue to evolve in a rapidly changing global economy, it is clear that some aspects of NAFTA no longer serve the interests of all parties as effectively as they once did. Our goal in these negotiations is to create a modernized trade agreement that fosters mutual prosperity, strengthens economic ties, and reflects the realities of the 21st century. This agreement must be fair, sustainable, and promote equitable growth for all three countries. It is time to address the challenges of today and build a trade framework that benefits everyone involved. Thank you.",

As the Prime Minister of Canada, I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining and enhancing the strong economic and political relationship that our countries have built over the years. NAFTA has been a cornerstone of our shared prosperity, and while we recognize that adjustments may be necessary to reflect the evolving global landscape, it is crucial that we do not lose sight of the fundamental principles of fairness and inclusivity. Canada is committed to working collaboratively with both the United States and Mexico to ensure that any new agreement creates opportunities for all our citizens, supports middle-class growth, and maintains the stability and certainty that businesses depend on. Our approach will always be grounded in the values of fairness, respect, and inclusivity for all parties involved. Thank you.",

As the U.S. Trade Representative, I would like to emphasize that the renegotiation of NAFTA is not just about modernizing an agreement; it is about ensuring that the interests of the American people are prioritized. NAFTA, while successful in some areas, has resulted in significant trade imbalances that have affected American workers and industries. Our goal in these negotiations is to level the playing field, protect American jobs, and create a fairer trade environment. We need stronger protections for American intellectual property, a better framework for dispute resolution, and more robust mechanisms to address trade deficits. We are committed to securing an agreement that strengthens the U.S. economy while maintaining strong partnerships with our neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Thank you.",

Como representante de México, me gustaría dejar en claro que la renegociación del TLCAN no se trata de culpar a nadie ni de centrarse únicamente en acuerdos pasados. Se trata de fortalecer nuestras relaciones trilaterales de una manera que beneficie a todas las partes involucradas. México siempre ha estado comprometido con el libre comercio y hemos trabajado arduamente para garantizar que el TLCAN haya creado oportunidades para las tres naciones. Sin embargo, es importante reconocer la necesidad de modernización, especialmente en lo que respecta a los nuevos desafíos globales, como el comercio digital y los estándares laborales. Nuestra prioridad es mantener un acuerdo equilibrado que garantice equidad y respeto mutuo para los intereses económicos y sociales de todos nuestros pueblos. México está comprometido con un proceso constructivo y colaborativo que garantice un futuro próspero para toda América del Norte. Gracias.",

        "speech": "Let me be clear, the United States has been more than patient in this process. For too long, NAFTA has been unbalanced, and it has hurt American workers. We have seen jobs move south of the border, and industries undermined by unfair trade practices. Mexico needs to step up and address these issues with concrete commitments, not just vague promises. The U.S. has been negotiating in good faith, but we will not back down from securing a fair deal that puts America first. If that means we need to make hard choices and walk away from the table, then so be it. We will not accept a deal that continues to disadvantage American interests. It is time for serious action, not more empty rhetoric. Thank you.",

NAFTA is not just about one country’s interests; it is about fostering mutual prosperity and ensuring that trade relationships benefit all parties involved. While the United States has valid concerns regarding imbalances, the European Union strongly believes that any agreement must promote fair competition and address structural inequalities without resorting to protectionism. We are committed to finding common ground, but we will not accept proposals that undermine global standards or isolate regions in an increasingly interconnected world. Cooperation, not confrontation, will lead to the best outcomes. Let us focus on long-term, sustainable solutions that respect the interests of all parties involved.",

However, we must also remember that NAFTA is about more than just addressing trade imbalances. It is about creating opportunities for our citizens, expanding markets for our industries, and ensuring that workers on both sides of the border can thrive. We will not allow fearmongering or protectionist rhetoric to dictate the terms of our agreement. Our priority is to ensure that this deal reflects the best interests of all Canadians and keeps us competitive on the global stage. Canada remains committed to working collaboratively, but we will not compromise on fundamental principles of fairness and mutual benefit.",

Creemos que los acuerdos comerciales no deben centrarse únicamente en el beneficio económico, sino también en el bienestar social, los derechos laborales y la protección del medio ambiente. La renegociación del TLCAN no debe verse como una oportunidad para una mayor explotación o la imposición de términos desiguales. Debemos asegurarnos de que el acuerdo beneficie no solo a las grandes corporaciones, sino también a los trabajadores de México, Estados Unidos y Canadá. Continuaremos firmes en la defensa de los intereses de nuestra nación y buscamos un acuerdo justo que fomente una verdadera colaboración y respeto para todas las partes involucradas.",

We’re here to make sure that all three countries benefit, but let me be clear: the United States will not settle for a bad deal. We want a better deal for American businesses, and a fair deal for all. We’ll make sure it’s a win-win situation, but only if it’s fair.",
